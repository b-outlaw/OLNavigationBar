# OLNavigationBar
There is a new UX and UI design at Goldstar in which we want to add multiple sections to the nav bar. A UISegmentedControl won't  work because we're anticipating having more than will fit in an  aesthetically pleasing way. Some of these section names are also fairly long in relation to what a UISegmentedControl is meant for.
